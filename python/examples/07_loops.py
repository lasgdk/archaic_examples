#Python loops

#The while loop:
int=0
while int < 10:
	print int
	int = int + 1
	print "this is within the loop"
print "this is not within the while loop, but will be printed after the loop."

#as you can see, we are using tabs to define what is within the loop.
#I think its a lame syntax, but whatever.
print

#For loop:
#do a list:
list1 = [1,2,3,42,321]
for bonk in list1:
	print "We are for-looping the list1...:"
	print bonk
#At the moment I think both loops looks quite lame, but thats python.. :)
