Python

Misc. examples by Lars Sommer, lasg@lasg.dk, 2005-03-29

Python is an interpreted object oriented programming language.
I like perl much more than python, but I think I should know a little about
 it anyway.
This is some very basic examples, but you should get yourself a good python book
 if you really want to learn something. These can perhaps just give you an
 idea about what python is like.

Random useful knowledge;
If your system does not have a python interpreter, you can get one at
 http://python.org/
You run your python scripts with the command "python <scriptname.py>"
If you begin your scripts with "#!/<path-to-python>", you can also run them
 with "./<scriptname.py>"
You can get more information about python with the command "man python"
 and by googling.
