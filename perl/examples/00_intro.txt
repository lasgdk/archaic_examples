Perl tutorialic examples
By Lars Sommer, lasg@lasg.dk, 2005-07-22

This is small examples and code snippets generated while I learned perl.
You can use it for whatever you want, (eg. look at it!) but if you really
 want to learn perl, you should get a book on the topic.

"man perl" is a _great_ man page. It tells about alot of other man pages,
 which actually can be used as fine starter manuals for perl programming.

Random knowledge:
You should include an interpreter line at top of your perl scripts. Like:
 "#!/usr/bin/perl", so that you can run your scripts with "./<scriptname.pl>"
Comments begin with #. #this is a comment, and are not parsed.
Perl is often used to cgi-programs in www-environments.

Get more info:

man perl
google perl
google/buy books on perl


You are welcome to write me if you have some kind of comment or question.
