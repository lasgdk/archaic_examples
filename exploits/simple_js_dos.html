Normally Firefox and IE detects these while(1) js, and asks if we want to kill
 the script. Firefox 1.5 in FreeBSD, and Firefox 1.0.7 in Windows XP asked to
 kill it, but when saying yes, the script continued, and build up full mem.usage

IE 6.0 in Windows XP didn't do anything but freeze and build up mem.usage.

Perhaps this could be used for something wrecked? Pls mail me if so.
